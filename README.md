## WIDS-project-AI-for-Self-Driving-Car-Build-a-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Report
# Week -1
I have studied the basics of the Python programming language to build a strong foundation. This included an introduction to Python syntax and learning how to implement core programming concepts such as loops, functions, and logical problem-solving structures. I practiced applying these concepts to solve algorithmic problems efficiently.

# Week -2
I have focused on Data Analysis, specifically learning Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). I utilized the Pandas and NumPy libraries to efficiently read, handle, and analyze input data. My work involved cleaning datasets and performing operations to prepare the data for accurate modeling.

# Week -3
I have transitioned into Machine Learning, covering the introduction to classical ML algorithms. I studied the theoretical and practical applications of Linear and Logistic Regression. I learned how to use these algorithms to analyze relationships between variables and perform classification tasks.

# Week -4
I have advanced to Deep Learning concepts, focusing on Neural Networks. I worked on building Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using the TensorFlow and Keras libraries. I applied these models to image classification tasks, specifically utilizing the MNIST dataset to understand model performance and architecture.

# Week -5
I have applied my cumulative knowledge to a capstone project focused on Autonomous Driving systems. I developed a Traffic Sign Classifier using the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset. My work involved constructing a robust Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with advanced layers like Dropout to prevent overfitting, optimizing the model to recognize 43 distinct classes of traffic signs with high accuracy.
